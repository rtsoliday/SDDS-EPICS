# SDDS-EPICS C/C++ ToolKit

## Overview
SDDS-EPICS is a collection of EPICS Channel Access applications and utilities built on the Self-Describing Data Set (SDDS) protocol.  It provides tools for data acquisition, monitoring, logging, and analysis in accelerator and beamline control systems.

## Prerequisites
